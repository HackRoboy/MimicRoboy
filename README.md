# MimicRoboy
Hackathon Project at Hack Roboy

#Mouth control
fa.py controls the mouth movement and want to send bezier curves to the unity file of roboy that it moves the mouth (connection is not working properly)

#Eyes control
creation of new eyes with Autodesk Maya.
Control of the eyes is possible with Faceware or can be included into the Python script.
